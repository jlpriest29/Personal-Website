# Personal-Website
A 3 page sample website about myself created using HTML and CSS.

The files are HTML files, CSS files, and PNG screenshots of each of the three pages of the website.

Included in the website is my name, details about myself, my contact information, as well as links to my LinkedIn and Github.

Please enjoy!

This is a personal project.
